Pickle Rick Maze Game
---
Simple JavaScript maze game created as coursework, contains simple sprites of pickle rick and his portal. The player can navigate a randomly generated maze and reach the exit. The randomly generated maze is achieved by using a recursive backtracking algorithm. This is a port from my C# maze game, this was primarily a way for me to practice my JavaScript while also allowing me to leverage the flexibility of the web technologies to create a decent looking UI.

Rather than re-invent the wheel I used a simple jQuery library to add swipe functionality so the game can be played on mobile.
