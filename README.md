# MazeGame

This is a basic Javascript maze game for me to practice OOP and create a nice looking UI for this web app. THe goal of this game is the user will be randomly generately at one of the corner and needs to reach the finish spot. The randomly generated maze is achieved by using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
